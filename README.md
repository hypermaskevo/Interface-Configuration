# Interface-Configuration
This lab focuses on basic interface configuration in Cisco Packet Tracer. The following tasks were performed:

1. **Configure hostnames** for all devices:
   - `R1`, `SW1`, and `SW2`

2. **Set IP addresses** for:
   - **Router R1**
   - **PC1, PC2, PC3, PC4**

3. **Manually configure speed and duplex** on interfaces connected to networking devices (e.g. switches and routers).

4. **Add interface descriptions**:
   - Interfaces were labeled to indicate purpose (e.g. `## to end hosts ##`, `## not in use ##`).

5. **Disable unused interfaces**:
   - All FastEthernet ports not connected to devices were administratively shut down to increase security and reduce errors.
